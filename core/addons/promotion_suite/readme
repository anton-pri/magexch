Promotion Suite

Product bundles for "Buy together" feature. 

Product bundles are based on hidden offers (condition: set of products; 
bonus: discount) and linked with certain product ID. 
Managed on product details page, but can be reviewed on offers 
management page using special GET param.  


"Captured" products

Every product in cart can be used in one offer only. 
If condition is mt and contains references to products or categories, 
then those products are marked as "captured" and cannot be used in 
further conditions.
Exception is product bundles. Product bundles are based on hidden 
offers, but such offers do not capture products and they can be used in 
other regular offers.


Discount

Only one best regular discount is chosen for cart and one best regular discount for every product.
Bundled discounts are additional to regular discounts, thus products can be discounted twice.


Shipping discount

Initially all shippings methods are calculated basing on full cart 
including free products. It is required to select only applicable 
shipping methods, which really can be used to dispatch the order.

After that realtime rates are re-calculated in proprotion of 
weight or subtotal of full cart and cart without free shipped products.

Manual rates are re-calculated again according to their formula with 
corrected weight/subtotal/items values.
