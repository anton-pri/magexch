                                [descr] => From 'Annan Shawhill Station and the Solway Viaduct': Annan (Shawhill) station had always consisted of a single passenger platform, just north of a short goods loop siding, with freight sidings and the goods shed to the west of that. This southwards looking photograph is of the north end of the station, which remained fully signalled for the working of passenger trains. Passenger traffic was never going to be heavy, so a single brake composite coach usually sufficed. Here, the regular branch engine LM&S 4-4-0T No. 15027 has run round its train and awaits departure to Kirtlebridge. The station building here, was a neat, L-shaped building, constructed of local stone and with some attractive embellishments, such as the finials and tall chimneys. Despite the paucity of passengers, there was a wide array of enamelled advertising signs adorning the building and the platform fence. The well maintained row of bushes alongside the track were another nice touch. In the background, the goods yard shows evidence of a healthy traffic, with covered vans, coal and cattle wagons all to be seen. The yard crane here, just visible above the cattle wagons, was of 5 tons capacity.

                        [descr] => From 'Annan Shawhill Station and the Solway Viaduct': Annan (Shawhill) station had always consisted of a single passenger platform, just north of a short goods loop siding, with freight sidings and the goods shed to the west of that. This southwards looking photograph is of the north end of the station, which remained fully signalled for the working of passenger trains. Passenger traffic was never going to be heavy, so a single brake composite coach usually sufficed. Here, the regular branch engine LM&S 4-4-0T No. 15027 has run round its train and awaits departure to Kirtlebridge. The station building here, was a neat, L-shaped building, constructed of local stone and with some attractive embellishments, such as the finials and tall chimneys. Despite the paucity of passengers, there was a wide array of enamelled advertising signs adorning the building and the platform fence. The well maintained row of bushes alongside the track were another nice touch. In the background, the goods yard shows evidence of a healthy traffic, with covered vans, coal and cattle wagons all to be seen. The yard crane here, just visible above the cattle wagons, was of 5 tons capacity.
